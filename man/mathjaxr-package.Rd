\title{Using MathJax in Rd Files}
\description{
   \loadmathjax
   The \pkg{mathjaxr} package allows for easy inclusion of \href{https://www.mathjax.org/}{MathJax} equations in Rd files. Package authors wanting to make use of the package and its functionality need to:

   \enumerate{
      \item install the \pkg{mathjaxr} package,
      \item add \verb{mathjaxr} to \verb{Suggests} or \verb{Imports} in the \file{DESCRIPTION} file of their package,
      \item add \verb{mathjaxr} to \verb{RdMacros} in the \file{DESCRIPTION} file of their package (or add \verb{RdMacros: mathjaxr} if the \file{DESCRIPTION} file does not yet contain a \verb{RdMacros} entry)
   }

   One can then enable the use of MathJax by calling the \code{\\loadmathjax} macro (that is provided by the \pkg{mathjaxr} package) within the \code{\\description{}} section of an Rd file.

   An inline equation can then be added with the \code{\\mjeqn{latex}{ascii}} macro, with the \LaTeX commands for the equation given between the first set of curly brackets (which will be rendered in the HTML and PDF help pages) and the plain-text version of the equation given between the second set of curly brackets (which will be shown in the plain text help). With the \code{\\mjdeqn{latex}{ascii}} macro, one can add \sQuote{displayed equations} (as in \LaTeX's \code{displaymath} environment). Single argument versions of these macros, namely \code{\\mjseqn{latexascii}} and \code{\\mjsdeqn{latexascii}}, are also available.

\details{
   The Javascript code for MathJax is contained in this package. If a user viewing a help page has \pkg{mathjaxr} installed, it will be retrieved from there, otherwise it will be retrieved from the CDN site \url{https://cdn.jsdelivr.net/npm/mathjax@3/es5/tex-chtml-full.js}. To force use of the CDN site, the user can set the environment variable \env{MATHJAXR.USECDN} to any non-blank value.

   Package authors who want to ensure that users can see the rendered equations in the HTML help pages also when offline should add \pkg{mathjaxr} to \verb{Imports}.

\section{Issues}{
   Care must be taken when using the less-than and greater-than symbols in equations as these might get interpreted by the browser as HTML tags. See \href{https://docs.mathjax.org/en/latest/input/tex/html.html}{here} for further details. Adding space around these symbols should solve this problem (e.g., instead of writing \code{\\mjseqn{i<j}}, write \code{\\mjseqn{i < j}}). Do not use the \code{\\lt} and \code{\\gt} macros provided by MathJax as these will cause problems when rendering the PDF help pages.

   Curly braces/brackets in equations also cause problems. Using \code{\\lbrace} and \code{\\rbrace} (possibly in combination with \code{\\left} and \code{\\right} to make them sufficiently large) is a solution (e.g., \code{\\mjseqn{\\left\\lbrace \\ldots \\right\\rbrace}} should render nicely in the HTML and PDF help pages).

   Also, while MathJax supports a large number of \LaTeX commands, only the math-mode commands are implemented. See \href{https://docs.mathjax.org/en/latest/input/tex/macros/index.html}{here} for a list of the supported commands.

\section{Example}{
   The probability density function of a normal distribution is given by \mjdeqn{f(x) = \frac{1}{\sqrt{2\pi} \sigma} e^{-\frac{1}{2}\left(\frac{x-\mu}{\sigma}\right)^2},}{f(x) = 1/(sqrt(2 pi) sigma) e^-((x - mu)^2/(2 sigma^2)),} where \mjseqn{\mu} denotes the mean of the distribution and \mjseqn{\sigma} its standard deviation.
