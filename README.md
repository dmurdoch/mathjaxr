mathjaxr: Using Mathjax in Rd Files
===================================

[![Build Status](https://travis-ci.org/wviechtb/mathjaxr.svg?branch=master)](https://travis-ci.org/wviechtb/mathjaxr)
![CRAN Version](https://www.r-pkg.org/badges/version/mathjaxr)
![devel Version](https://img.shields.io/badge/devel-0.9--4-brightgreen.svg)

## Description

The `mathjaxr` package allows for easy inclusion of [MathJax](https://www.mathjax.org/) equations in Rd files. Package authors wanting to make use of the package and its functionality need to:

1. install the `mathjaxr` package,
2. add `mathjaxr` to `Suggests` or `Imports` in the `DESCRIPTION` file of their package,
3. add `mathjaxr` to `RdMacros` in the `DESCRIPTION` file of their package (or add `RdMacros: mathjaxr` if the `DESCRIPTION` file does not yet contain a `RdMacros` entry),

One can then enable the use of MathJax by calling the `\loadmathjax` macro (that is provided by the `mathjaxr` package) within the `\description{}` section of an `.Rd` file.

An inline equation can then be added with the `\mjeqn{latex}{ascii}` macro, with the LaTeX commands for the equation given between the first set of curly brackets (which will be rendered in the HTML and PDF help pages) and the plain-text version of the equation given between the second set of curly brackets (which will be shown in the plain text help). With the `\mjdeqn{latex}{ascii}` macro, one can add 'displayed equations' (as in LaTeX's `displaymath` environment). Single argument versions of these macros, namely `\mjseqn{latexascii}` and `\mjsdeqn{latexascii}`, are also available.

## Details

The Javascript code for MathJax is contained in this package. If a user viewing a help page has `mathjaxr` installed, it will be retrieved from there, otherwise it will be retrieved from the CDN site https://cdn.jsdelivr.net/npm/mathjax@3/es5/tex-chtml-full.js. To force use of the CDN site, the user can set the environment variable `MATHJAXR.USECDN` to any non-blank value.

Package authors who want to ensure that users can see the rendered equations in the HTML help pages also when offline should add `mathjaxr` to `Imports`.

## Issues

Care must be taken when using the less-than and greater-than symbols in equations as these might get interpreted by the browser as HTML tags. See [here](https://docs.mathjax.org/en/latest/input/tex/html.html) for further details. Adding space around these symbols should solve this problem (e.g., instead of writing `\mjseqn{i<j}`, write `\mjseqn{i < j}`). Do not use the `\lt` and `\gt` macros provided by MathJax as these will cause problems when rendering the PDF help pages.

Curly braces/brackets in equations also cause problems. Using `\lbrace` and `\rbrace` (possibly in combination with `\left` and `\right` to make them sufficiently large) is a solution (e.g., `\mjseqn{\left\lbrace \ldots \right\rbrace}` should render nicely in the HTML and PDF help pages).

Also, while MathJax supports a large number of LaTeX commands, only the math-mode commands are implemented. See [here](https://docs.mathjax.org/en/latest/input/tex/macros/index.html) for a list of the supported commands.

## Installation

The current official (i.e., [CRAN](https://cran.r-project.org/package=mathjaxr)) release can be installed directly within R with:

```r
install.packages("mathjaxr")
```

After installing the [remotes](https://cran.r-project.org/package=remotes) package with ```install.packages("remotes")```, the development version of the `mathjaxr` package can be installed with:

```r
remotes::install_github("wviechtb/mathjaxr")
```
